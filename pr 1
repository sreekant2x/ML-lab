# Install and set up Python and essential libraries like NumPy and pandas.
Installing Python:
1. Download Python: Go to the official Python website download the latest 
version suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. Install Python:
• For Windows: Run the downloaded installer and make sure to check the 
box that says "Add Python x.x to PATH" during installation.
• For Linux: Python might already be installed. If not, use your package 
manager to install it (e.g., sudo apt-get install python3 for Ubuntu).
3. Verify Installation:
• Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).
• Type python --version or python3 --version and press Enter. You 
should see the installed Python version.
Installing NumPy and pandas:
1. Using pip:
• Pip is Python's package manager. It usually comes installed with Python. 
Open a terminal/command prompt.
2. Install NumPy:
• Type pip install numpy and press Enter. This command will download 
and install NumPy.
3. Install pandas:
• Type pip install pandas and press Enter. This will download and install 
pandas.
4. Verify installations:
• Open a Python interpreter by typing python or python3 in the terminal.
• Inside the interpreter, import NumPy and pandas:
import numpy
import pandas
If no errors occur, both libraries are installed correctly.
